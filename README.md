Tools and Libraries
1. NumPy
Description: NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with an extensive collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. NumPy's array-oriented computing capabilities make it indispensable for tasks such as linear algebra, Fourier analysis, and random number generation.

2. Pandas
Description: Pandas is a versatile library for data manipulation and analysis built on top of NumPy. It introduces two primary data structures: Series (one-dimensional labeled array) and DataFrame (two-dimensional labeled data structure resembling a table). Pandas simplifies tasks such as loading data from various file formats, cleaning and preprocessing data, and performing data manipulation operations like filtering, grouping, and merging.

3. Matplotlib
Description: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. It provides a wide range of plotting functions to generate various types of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, box plots, and more. Matplotlib's flexibility and customization options allow users to create publication-quality visualizations tailored to their specific requirements.

4. Seaborn
Description: Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn simplifies the process of generating complex visualizations by offering a range of predefined themes, color palettes, and plot types. It also includes specialized functions for exploring relationships in data, such as categorical plots, regression plots, and distribution plots.

5. SQLite
Description: SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database engine. It is designed for simplicity, reliability, and ease of use, making it well-suited for managing small to medium-sized databases. SQLite stores the entire database as a single disk file, eliminating the need for a separate database server. It supports standard SQL features, transactions, and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, making it suitable for various applications, including embedded systems, mobile apps, and prototyping.
